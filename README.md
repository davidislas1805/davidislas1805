# Hi I'm David

## About Me:
Mechatronics Engineer with a special interests in both electronics and computing.

I've some experience with programming, mainly in python, c and c++ and to some extent with ROS. In my last year of college I came in touch with embedded programming. (MouseOver the images :wink:)

## Projects:
The projects that I have worked in are:
- __Embedded flight simulator:__ developed in a STM32F407VE Black Board that captured information from a joystic to get position an control some servomotors and acquire data from an IMU. This simulator also included a graphical overview of the data shown in an EVK1105. This project used DMA, PWM, ADC, TIMERS, USART and SPI.
-  __Holonomic Car:__ using the OSOYOO Holonomic Car, the platform was adjusted, with a PCB being design to drive the car using an ESP32 microcontroller. Among the things that this project included is a future implementation in ROS. [More here](https://github.com/davidislas1805/HolonomicCarv1)
